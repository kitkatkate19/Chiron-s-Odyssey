# Chiron's Odyssey 🛡️

## From Zero to Cybersecurity Hero

My journey into cybersecurity began from absolute zero. Unlike many in this field, I started with no technical background - I couldn't tell you what a CPU was, let alone write a line of code. I was, in every sense, a complete technology novice.

### 🌊 The Challenge of Information Overload

The path of self-learning proved challenging. The internet offered an ocean of free resources, tutorials, and expert advice, but this abundance became overwhelming. Information overload wasn't just a roadblock - it was a maze where I frequently lost my way. I soon discovered I wasn't alone; countless aspiring cybersecurity professionals face this same challenge.

### 🎯 Purpose

While many experienced professionals share their knowledge generously, they often forget what it's like to be a beginner. Their advanced perspectives, though valuable, can feel disconnected from a newcomer's struggles. This realization inspired Chiron's Odyssey - a documented journey of my self-learning journey.
